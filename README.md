=== Repositories === 

The repository layer is added to ensure that the data provider can be switched with minimum effort. 


=== Dependencies === 
I have avoided using larger frameworks such as AngularJS because I want to minimise dependencies and the idea behind this project is more to be used as an extension in other projects. 
The following is a list of dependencies and why they are included: 

 * ts-promise - Needed for promises as they are not natively supported by all browsers
 * SodaJs
